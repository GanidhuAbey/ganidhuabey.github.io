# About

Hi! I'm a computer science student currently in school, I'm particularly interested in computer graphics. I'm currently working on my own renderer and other small projects to improve my knowledge in the field (you can find my work on the Projects page!)

Outside of programming I love to spend time outdoors (snowboarding, mountain biking) and enjoy learning the guitar
