# Work Experience

**Huawei Canada (September 2022 - 2024)**

Worked on developing new techonlogy on top of open source game engine "O3DE" that was worked on in partnership with Amazon. My role involved developing a high-quality real-time hair rendering system that rivalled industry competitors (e.g. Unreal, EA, Unity, etc.). Some of my notable contributions are listed below:

- Implemented new shadow mapping technique to resolve shadow resolution issues for hair shadows. Achieved a 16x visual improvement in terms of of shadow resolution while maintaining similar performance.

- Re-hauled hair shadow system to account for semi-transparency of hair strands. New system improved the visual accuracy of hair shadows, eliminating 90% of visual error previously visible on curly hair assets.

- Optimized shaders in the hair system. Reduced memory overhead by effectively re-using dynamic read-write memory when possible, removing dynamic branches, and optimized memory accesses. These optimizations contributed to a 20-30% performance improvement and reduced memory footprint by 50MB.

- Improved upon the TressFX simulation length constraint algorithm. New simulation maintained original hair volume 30% more effectively under extreme movement.

- Worked on mobile development with advanced hair rendering. Optimized hair rendering system for mobile by moving to half-floats, reducing memory usage, and simplifying existing lighting algorithms. Achieved interactive frame rates while maintaining PC level quality.
